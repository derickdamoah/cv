        <h1>Derick Damoah Twum</h1>
        <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
        <p>A self-taught software developer with a background in Accounting and Finance. Developed a keen interest in software
          applications during my first year at university, after taking a course in VBA programming. I decided to conduct a deep
          exploration of the technology industry and focus on learning how to code; starting from the basics of Python and now
          moving into full-stack development. As I continue with the research and upskilling myself, I am seeking entry-level
          opportunities to work in the software development domain.
